# üè¶ Java Selenium Banking Project

This project automates end-to-end functional testing of the **GlobalSQA Banking Project** web application (https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/) using **Java + Selenium WebDriver**. It validates key customer and manager workflows including login, account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction verification.  

Tools: Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, IntelliJ IDEA, Git & GitHub.  

Automated tests cover customer login/logout, manager login and customer creation, account operations, and transaction verification. Test results can be viewed directly in the IDE‚Äôs test runner or console output, and screenshots or logs can be added to the README if desired.  

CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions will be added to run tests automatically on each push.
